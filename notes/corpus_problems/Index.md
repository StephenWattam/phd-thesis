Corpus Problems
===============
This is a transcription of the aÂ£ sheet of notes, designed as an intermediate format before writing into the thesis.

It's organised in blocks of various smaller issues, each of which might become its own document eventually.


Covariates + Population Specification
-------------------------------------


### Poor definition of population


### Time effects and distribution 
Largely affects replicability + representativeness.  Temporal effects are hard to control for when sampling so long after text is produced. 


### Failure to define categories 
w.r.t. 1) external covariates, 2) language features [not statistically rigorous]



Practical Issues
----------------

### Copyright

### Lack of a central index

### Time taken to gather data

### Privacy and context (+ethics)

### Cultural taboo (ethics)

### Ephemera and lack of record-keeping


Stratum Selection [external validity?]
--------------------------------------

### Most covariates not considered, or considered in a haphazard manner

### Non-mutually-exclusive categories used

### lack of variability/saturation analysis/multi-phase

### Incomplete coverage of population 
(definitely external validity)

### Insufficient consideration of external demographic information

### No minimum sizes of categories, or analysis thereof.




Randomness [internal validity?]
-------------------------------

### Most covariates not considered (see stratum selection)

### Lack of variance/saturation analysis (see stratum selection)

### Oversampling of easy but homogenous groups 
(i.e. book lists)

### Nonrandom sampling of stuff 
(i.e. web crawls)

### Incomplete coverage within each stratum [use of proxy vars]


Size
----

### No overall size established 
(w.r.t strata, and randomness above)

### No methods for saturation/internal measures

### No multi-phase/IWP design


Sampling Unit
-------------

### Too large sampling unit damages corpus coverage
i.e. for a given corpus size in words, the size in units may be too small.

### Conventionalised to a weird/large number 
(2k) (Biber)

### Heterogenous between corpora 
(see comparison)

### "clumpiness" of language is not considered

### Not formally specified or justified using semantic models


Comparability
-------------

### Sampling unit

### Poor documentation of intent, sampling policy, population bounds
