Formal Sampling Notes
====================
These notes are largely based on the "Sampling: Design and Analysis" book.

Section 1.3 covers sampling bias:

 * Using a sampling selection procedure that, in an unknown way, relates to the properties being measured
 * Deliberately selecting a 'representative' sample based on the properties being measured (judgement sample)
 * Mis-specification of target population
 * under-coverage of target population
 * over-coverage of target population 'when data collectors are not given explicit descriptions of eligilibilty'
 * Multiplicity of listings in the sample frame (i.e. sampling people using books, where some people write more than one book)
 * Substitution of convenient but imperfect items for their ideal counterparts
 * Nonresponse/failure to collect data.  Nonresponse reasons often correlate with properties being measured.
 * Availability sampling

In addition to the above, measurement error may cause errors in the data returned.  Consistent measurement error is called measurement bias.  Many measurement biases are due to social effects, or due to a given measure being an imperfect way of mearusing a given thing.

Questionnaires ought to be tested!  

Sampling error is the error from taking a sample rather than using the whole population.  NonSampling Error is from other sources, such as bias.

Anders Kiaer, 1897, started using samping for collecting Norwegian political data, sparking debate around whether or not a census is the only way to accurately represent things.   This nicely parallels the arguments of Chomsky, and offers intuitive reasons for him being wrong.
