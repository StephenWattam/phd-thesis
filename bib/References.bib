	to reduce the dimensionality of multivariate data. The fact that
	the standard model is strictly applicable only when the manifest
	variables are scaled is a serious limitation in social science where
	the variables are often categorical. In this paper we aim to provide
	a theoretical framework within which methods for the factor analysis
	of categorical data can be devised and compared. Discussion is restricted
	to the case of ordered categories where the latent variables are
	continuous. It is argued that the choice of model should be made
	from a restricted set which includes two existing models as special
	cases. A new method is proposed together with a simple approximate
	technique of fitting for the one-factor model. The paper concludes
	with an evaluation of existing methods and makes some suggestions

  abstract = {During 1972-86, the Sparrowhawk breeding population in Eskdale, southern
	Scotland, remained fairly stable, with nest numbers fluctuating between
	29 and 39 in different years. The annual production of young varied
	rather more, between 44 and 86 in different years. In a key factor
	analysis, the 'overwinter loss' operating in the period between the
	fledging of young and subsequent recruitment to the breeding population,
	emerged as the 'key factor', explaining 77% of the variance in total
	annual loss, and largely accounting for the pattern of change in
	breeding numbers. Overwinter loss in each new cohort was also the
	only form of loss which was density dependent. In a simulation model
	this loss was found to be capable, on its own, of stabilising the
	nesting population at the mean level observed. Losses during the
	breeding season were inversely correlated with losses over the ensuing
	winter. Thus, good breeding seasons, when many young were produced,
	were followed by high losses over winter, while poor breeding seasons
	were followed by reduced losses over winter. No density dependence
	was detected at any stage of breeding, or in the annual mortality
	of established breeders.},
