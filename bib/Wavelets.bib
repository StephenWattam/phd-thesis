  abstract = {We discuss a Bayesian formalism which gives rise to a type of wavelet
	threshold estimation in nonparametric regression. A prior distribution
	is imposed on the wavelet coefficients of the unknown response function,
	designed to capture the sparseness of wavelet expansion that is common
	to most applications. For the prior specified, the posterior median
	yields a thresholding procedure. Our prior model for the underlying
	function can be adjusted to give functions falling in any specific
	Besov space. We establish a relationship between the hyperparameters
	of the prior model and the parameters of those Besov spaces within
	which realizations from the prior will fall. Such a relationship
	gives insight into the meaning of the Besov space parameters. Moreover,
	the relationship established makes it possible in principle to incorporate
	prior knowledge about the function's regularity properties into the
	prior model for its wavelet coefficients. However, prior knowledge
	about a function's regularity properties might be difficult to elicit;
	with this in mind, we propose a standard choice of prior hyperparameters
	that works well in our examples. Several simulated examples are used
	to illustrate our method, and comparisons are made with other thresholding
	methods. We also present an application to a data set that was collected
	in an anaesthesiological study.},
