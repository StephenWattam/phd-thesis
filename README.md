# My Ph.D Thesis
This repository contains five years of occasionally hard work, distilled into 200 pages of writing about representativeness in corpus design, and how Web-as-Corpus techniques can be used to improve it.

The final document is available at [https://stephenwattam.com/cv](https://stephenwattam.com/cv/).  I recommend reading that rather than compiling this repository.

## Compilation

    $ cd document && make

Should build the imaginatively-named `thesis.pdf`
