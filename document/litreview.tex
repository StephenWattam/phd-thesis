\section{Introduction}
<Coropora for non-linguists.>


\til{Intro to use of corpora --- basically what people do with them [note, not what they are, that comes later], what they contain (roughly) and special/general purpose.  See this as an intro for non-linguists and some signposting}

`Corpora and Corpus Linguistics' starts the chapter with a discussion of what comprises a corpus, the form they take and the properties each may take.  It explains some of the history of corpus methods, and discusses the definition of corpus used in this thesis, for which I shall be aiming when constructing tools and methods to work with corpora.

`Formally Sampling Language' inspects the idea of corpus construction as social-science sample building.  It examines current statistical methods in order to assess the applicability of each, and relates this to instances where each has been used in an important corpus building effort.

`New Technologies' looks at the rise in Web-as-Corpus, the proliferation of documents that originate digitally, and the opportunities that have been afforded by the recent ubiquity of powerful portable computing machinery.
