\section{Performance of Heuristics}
\label{sec:evaluation:heuristics}
\input{tex/evaluation/heuristics}


\section{Method}
\label{sec:evaluation:method}
Discuss the evaluation methods.  Firstly talk about the error monitoring methods built into the program, then detail the linguistic feature analysis.  This is the main body of the analysis of the method and doesn't cover the heuristics


\section{Data}
\label{sec:evaluation:method}
Discuss which corpora were chosen and why

\section{Results}
\label{sec:evaluation:}
Provide quantitative measures for the two evaluation methods
\subsection{Partial/white box}
Show how well classifiers and heuristics behave
\subsection{Complete/black box}
Show how well the whole system works


\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:evaluation:discussion}
Talk about the various strengths/weaknesses w.r.t. the original RQs and the goals in ch5.
\subsection{Choice of submodules}
talk about which heuristics seem good, and what needs improving


\section{Summary}
How well does the system work w.r.t. chapter 5 aims and objectives, and how well does this chapter 
answer its own RQs.


\section{Further Work}
\label{sec:evaluation:furtherwork}
Cover the heuristics and modules that need making, and possible tweaks to the error feedback mechanism.  Also comment on the knowledge we have of various populations online and how this impacts inherited bias.

Link to an appendix with the generalised form of the proxy corpus thingy?
