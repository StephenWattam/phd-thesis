We have seen in previous chapters (\td{which}) a number of scientific and practical issues that affect current corpus collection methods.

This chapter details the design and implementation of a method for performing number of common corpus building workflows.  These workflows are designed both as a continuation of the methods detailed in chapter~\td{chapter 4} and as part of work with existing corpora, and represent areas of scientific importance in corpus studies.

The chapter begins in Section~\ref{sec:rebuilding:rationale} with an outline of the workflows involved, detailing the rationale behind each, and the value that formalising the process may yield.

Immediately following is an outline of the design of the method, specifying the processes involved and comparing them both to existing procedures and to the original workflows.

The method section (\td{ref}) describes the mechanisms used to implement these designs, and covers the architecture of the software used to test the method.  It discussed the algorithms used, as well as the variables selected for the test system and the strengths and weaknesses of these as a mechanism for evaluating the method described earlier.

The implementation section (\td{ref}) specifies the technical details of the solution, and provides details on the approximation and optimisation methods used.  

Finally, the conclusion relates the design and implementation of the software back to the aims detailed in \td{ref chapter 2}, drawing comparisons again to the capabilities of other existing systems.
