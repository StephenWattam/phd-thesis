The literature surrounding this thesis falls loosely into three areas:\td{ugly phrasing}  

The first of these covers `Corpora and Corpus Linguistics', and is titled accordingly.  This forms the background of the problem, and serves to establish working definitions around which the rest of the studies will be based.  It begins with a short historical retrospective covering the history of (modern) corpus linguistics, and the milestones in corpus design.  It uses these, alongside other reviews thereof, to derive a working definition of a corpus which shall be used in subsequent chapters.

% TODO: justify and flow between these?
Secondly, the problem of sampling in the abstract sense will be inspected in `Formally Sampling Language'.  This serves as a foil against which we may examine the conventional sampling methods in~\ref{sec:litreview-corpora}, and is used in later chapters \td{which?} to derive alternative sampling methods.  \td{this next bit is subject to change as I apply DB's comments}  It begins by covering the desirable properties of a corpus in terms of sampling theory, and examines existing sampling methods for their suitability to the problem.


Lastly, `New Technologies' offers a background in the opportunities afforded by technological development.  It charts the rise of WaC methods\td{except that this might be moved so perhaps it doesn't}, and covers the proliferation of digital-origin documents and mobile and ubiquitous technology.
