\subsection{Method}
\label{sec:evaluation:method}
Discuss the evaluation methods.  Firstly talk about the error monitoring methods built into the program, then detail the linguistic feature analysis.  This is the main body of the analysis of the method and doesn't cover the heuristics


\subsection{Data}
\label{sec:evaluation:method}
Discuss which corpora were chosen and why

\subsection{Results}
\label{sec:evaluation:}
Provide quantitative measures for the two evaluation methods
%#\subsubsection{Partial/white box}
%Show how well classifiers and heuristics behave
\subsubsection{Complete/black box}
Show how well the whole system works
