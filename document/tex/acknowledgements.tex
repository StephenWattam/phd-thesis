This thesis could not have been completed without the support of many people.  Through the considerable time it took, many academics and friends have helped answer my questions and allay (or confirm!) my fears.  My thanks go out to all members of UCREL, who taught me the ways of the corpus.

Foremost amongst these must be my supervisors, Paul Rayson and Damon Berridge.  Their direction and encouragement was often the only thing keeping me in the office, and it is hard to overstate their influence.

Secondly, my friends, particularly Carl Ellis, Matthew Edwards, John Vidler and John Hardy.  Our (sometimes not so) implicit competition has been endlessly motivating.

Finally, I wish to thank my parents.  It is doubtless my mother's lesson to question the world that has lead me into research, and my father's work ethic (however diluted during inheritance) that has carried me this far.

Thank you all.
