This thesis could not have been completed without the support of many people.  Foremost  amongst these must be my supervisors, Paul Rayson and Damon Berridge.  Their direction and encouragement was often the only thing keeping me in the office.

Secondly, my friends, particularly Carl Ellis and John Hardy, have been instrumental in honing my approach to work and life.% TODO: more.

Finally, I wish to thank my parents.  It is doubtless my mother's lesson to question the world that has lead me into research, and my father's work ethic (however diluted during inheritance) that has carried me this far.

Thank you all.
