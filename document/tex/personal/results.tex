These results describe data collected during the third iteration of sampling, which lasted roughly two weeks during April 2013.  Table~\ref{fig:personal:dataoverview} describes the availability of data per-day.

The period marked from Friday the 5th to Friday the 19th (inclusive) forms the sampling period described herein (with exceptions to this noted where made).  This was the period for which the on-line notebook was maintained along with other intrusive data collection techniques, though notably some methods continued afterwards due to their ease-of-use.

Audio data is missing for the 19th as sampling was initially intended to end the day before, however, for producing estimated word counts this was not used as other recording methods cover the data sources.  Though attempts were made to use the audio data, difficulties in automated processing meant that transcription (or precise word counts) were only possible using manual review (something only the subject could legally perform).  Word counts were instead based on an estimated words-per-minute.


This fifteen-day recording period covers 8,619 linguistic events, encompassing an estimated 980,000 words.  In total 3.4GB of data were collected, though the majority of this figure (2.3GB, 67\%) of this is audio data.  This is roughly in line with other life-logging studies~\cite{gemmell2006mylifebits}.

The overall word count is changed massively by disabling the attention model, rising to roughly 5 million words.  As we shall see later, this is largely because the data sources and genres which dominate the data set are particularly heavily adjusted.  This raises the question of how we may ensure accuracy of attention models, something that shall be addressed in the discussion section below.




% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Variables}
Variables recorded on each linguistic event are based heavily on Lee's BNC index, augmented to take into account the attention index and word count estimates.  A summary of these is provided in Table~\ref{table:personal:variables}.  The \variable{missing} column describes the proportion of rows missing this field, either because it is not applicable, or because insufficient data was recorded to complete it with confidence.

The variables \variable{source2} and \variable{duration} have missing values exclusively due to non-applicability.  As such they have been integrated into (complete) summary variables for analysis, forming the computed words and computer genre in an effort to unify measurement of spoken and written material, and increase the specificity of the data source recorded.

\subsection{Activities}
During the sampling period, all work surrounding the personal corpus case study was stopped, in favour of other, ongoing, projects.  Other than this intervention, work continued as normal, which for this period involved significant amounts of development on the LWAC downloader tool.

This meant that the bulk of each day was taken up with terminal output events, and editing files.  Part of this work involved writing ruby code, diffs from which were used to construct token counts of the `code/ruby'\td{monospace using whatever} type.  Another significant portion of this time was spent documenting the tool, which required production of longer textual documents (rather than code).  During work, the subject listened either to the radio, or to music, accounting for the large volume of broadcast media and music in the corpus.

Mornings and evenings also usually featured the radio, and often some form of TV (either streamed online or broadcast).

\subsection{Distribution}

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{personal/ebyday}
    \caption{Daily event frequencies}
    \label{fig:personal:eventcountbyday}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:personal:eventcountbyday} shows the number of events recorded each day.  Event counts ranging from 124 to 969, with much of the variation being expressed in terms of written data.

Contrary to expectations, and in part due to large amounts of terminal and web use during software development work, the majority of daily language use is written.  This is contrasted by Figure~\ref{fig:personal:wordcountbyday}, which indicates that spoken events are likely to expunge greater amounts of words in a single event (spoken median is 128 words, vs. 27 words for written).  This is largely explainable by a penchant for consuming broadcast media (especially spoken radio), which have large amounts of ongoing spoken content.

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{personal/cbyday}
    \caption{Daily word counts}
    \label{fig:personal:wordcountbyday}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:personal:eventcountbyday}, the event count as broken down by day shows that between 35,000 and 80,000 words were used each day.  As we shall see later, this is mainly explainable by way of broadcast media and web page views.  It is notable that weekends fall upon days 6,7,13 and 14.  There is no significant pattern by day.

Before this study it was conjectured that the vast majority of all language used would be spoken.

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{personal/prodbyday}
    \caption{Daily word counts broken down by receipient status}
    \label{fig:personal:prodcountbyday}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:personal:prodcountbyday} shows the breakdown of words used by the subject, by others, or in a manner inseparable for the purposes of the linguistic event (such as conversation).  Overall 85\% of words were consumed (95\% of events), 15\% were interactive (just 4\% of events) and 0.5\% were produced (0.5\% of events).  This indicates that linguistic events involving some level of interaction yield more words, either by form or duration, something backed up by median frequencies (55 words for production, 27 for consumption, and 80 for interaction events).

The proportions described in Figure~\ref{fig:personal:eventsbysource} are likely a very individual trait of the subject, affected not only by daily routine, but also the specific work being undertaken at the time of the sample (the implications of this on scientific validity are discussed below in section~\ref{sec:personal:discussion:ethics}.

Particularly curious is the large number of terminal, web (squid), and music events.  These are partially explainable by the work being completed at the time of the study, as the subject was developing software, listening to music whilst doing so and using many web references as documentation.  The subject also uses a GUI on his computer that mandates use of terminals for many tasks (this is doubtless atypical of many populations).

Table~\ref{table:personal:eventcountbygenre} shows a breakdown of event frequencies by computed genre (which includes the source).  This shows a somewhat predictable Zipfian distribution of genres surrounding a number of themes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Daily events, such as reading social media websites
    \item Short events, such as consuming single programs of media (especially songs due to additive effects with the above)
    \item Any of the above that are particularly surrounding personal interests of the subject
\end{itemize}

Clearly, the last of these is the most obvious and desirable effect of building a corpus using this method.  The overwhelming prevalence of \texttt{web/entertainment/social} events may be explained (rather embarrassingly) by one website, \url{imgur.com}, which displays a single image per page (along with socially-contributed captions), and thus demands a lot of page reloads for relatively little content.

\FloatBarrier

The mean words-per-event for each genre is listed in Table~\ref{fig:personal:genreworddist}.  The embedded graph shows a log-distribution of the word count for each, displaying a typical Zipfian distribution but with an unusually fat tail (that drops off sharply at the 5 word level).  This would seem to indicate the minimum word length necessary to convey information without presupposing context, (i.e. branding, packaging and signage).

\subsection{Word Counts}

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering

    \begin{tabular}{ | r | r | r | r | r | r | r | r | }
         \hline
         & 5\% & 10\% & 20\% & 50\% & 70\% & 90\% & 95\% \\ 
         \hline
         1 & 0.00 & 0.00 & 8.90 & 27.85 & 74.00 & 217.00 & 354.88 \\ 
         \hline
    \end{tabular}

    \caption{Percentiles for words-per-event.}
    \label{table:personal:wordsperevent}
\end{table}

Word counts were established either directly, or by assuming an 80 word-per-minute speech rate.  This rate is a conservative estimate according to some literature---\cite{yuan2006towards} estimate almost twice this, however, they do so for continuous conversation, and much of the corpus' spoken data comes from media with interruptions such as TV or music.  The music included in the corpus typically has speech rates falling between $40$ and $70$ WPM.  

Table~\ref{table:personal:wordsperevent} shows that the distribution of word count per event is heavily skewed towards the lower end, with the median being 27 words per event.

This figure also reflects the degree to which the attention model affects results---disabling calculations for this, the median word count is affected significantly by the largest source of data, web pages, becoming 442 words.  Most pages are, even compared to other types of event in the corpus, read only partially (often graphical clues indicate which portions to read, especially since most people revisit websites more than they visit new ones).

Figure~\ref{fig:personal:prodcountbyday} shows that the vast majority of all words are consumed, either passively as the result of receiving broadcast media or in part of a conversation.  The vast majority of the `produced' word count is covered by writing documentation for LWAC, and it would seem likely that most people would non-interactively use spoken words.








% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Comparisons}
% \til{Table of high-level genres for the two (align them). This could be done by re-coding existing genres or by fitting both to higher-level ones (the latter might be clearer and less work)}



% Comparisons against BNC for genres, word counts etc.  Also extract demographic info from BNC for more targeted comparison
At a large scale, there are some obvious differences between the personal corpus and the BNC's selection.

One of the most striking of these is the rate of broadcast media consumption, which forms a full 50\% of the subject's spoken word count, yet only 10\% of the BNC's.  There is a fair argument to say that many people of a similar age, who grew up surrounded by online streaming services and easy access to cheap receiving devices, will share this disparity.

A less compelling difference is exhibited between the rate of spoken conversations---our subject's spoken data was 20\% conversational, whereas the BNC contains 40\% conversational data (as a proportion of its spoken component).  The degree to which this applies to others is difficult to estimate, since (contrary to the verbiage of this thesis) the subject may simply be unusually laconic.



Arguments for the diversity of texts within corpora are driven only vaguely by the quantitative findings of this study due to its restricted inter-person relevance.  Nonetheless, some trends were identified which could reasonably be expected to extend to many others in a similar culture.

Inspecting the selection of genres yields a diversity not covered in many corpora.  Though notably the BNC is quite good at this, covering many brochures and other incidental texts such as unpublished letters or school essays, it hardly represents the amount of times thanks were exchanged for holding a door open, bottles, cans and other labels were read (particularly addresses on mail), or a tax disc was checked.  It would seem that a corpus purporting to cover a large population would be awash with weirder texts, especially as those less academic than the subject here are likely to have relatively higher proportions of them in their corpora.

A particularly compelling argument is made for the inclusion of song lyrics.  These are a large portion of the corpus collected here  ($163,288 words$), and often spawn sayings, memes and linguistic affectations that can last decades in popular culture (\textit{will you do the Fandango?}).  It's also notable that this is one of the easier things to sample and music use by the population is meticulously documented and studied by the industry already (often in publicly available lists).  In the case of music, use of English as a lingua franca would see its influence spread far beyond the bounds of a national corpus (as well as absorbing influences from other national flavours of the language% Gasolina or Shakira's spanish singing?
).









% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Genres Absent from the Corpora}
There are a number of genres absent from the corpus that are listed in the BNC.  Examples of this that are unlikely to change if the sampling period is extended indicate lifestyle differences and, in sum, indicate the likely representativeness of the BNC relative to the subject.  Where a genre is seen as likely to be represented given sufficient time, they are evidence that the sampling period was insufficient (something that the BNC's breadth mitigates).

Comparisons were performed between the list of composite source/genres given in Table~\ref{table:personal:wordsperevent} and Lee's genre listings.  Where any overlap was judged to have occurred, a genre was discounted entirely.

    \caption{Major categories missing from the personal corpus but present in the BNC.}
    \label{table:personal:missingcatspersonal}
\end{table}


The 11 (of 24) top-level categories missing entirely are summarised in Table~\ref{table:personal:missingcatspersonal}.  Of those spoken, only interviews and lectures are likely to ever be encountered by the subject during a longer sampling period.  The former of these would require a sampling period of years for most subjects.

Written material is more comprehensively covered, with 15 of 46 genres missing.  Whilst newspaper articles are absent from the corpus in their original form, many of the same genre were read online (with the exception of sports articles).  

% ---
As expected, the genres identified within the personal corpus are an imperfect subset of those featured in the BNC.  Following Lee's index, there are no magazines, religious texts, newspapers, dramatic scripts, school or university essays, texts on the subject of commerce/economics or academic texts in many fields.  Newspapers alone comprise 9.9\% of the BNC, implying that caution should be exercised before applying any findings from the BNC to any single subject. % However, another criticism could be that the BNC is 100 times the size...

Any comparison should also take into account the size differential---the BNC is roughly 100 times the size, and it is reasonable to presume that many of these genres would be covered by a 100-person replication of the two-week sampling procedure.  The strength of this assumption is something the current experimental design is incapable of evaluating.


% Though 100 times larger, the BNC purports to cover a significantly larger population (some 60-million times larger).  Since there are obvious deficiencies in the representativeness of the personal corpus, with its deliberately restricted coverage, it seems unreasonable to expect that the BNC is a high-quality proportional sample.  Its individual genres may be capable of covering a genre of text sufficiently, but the thing as a whole isn't sufficient.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Demographic Changes}
A number of these genre differences are specifically down to the demographic coverage of the corpus (or lack thereof).  Though these differences are to be expected due to differences in corpus design, they illustrate the fallacy of applying results obtained for a population to any individual therein without qualification.

These categories have been selected because they are not only missing from the personal corpus, but are likely to remain missing for the subject, regardless of the sampling duration used.

Such missing categories include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item School work (and thus many essays)
    \item Anything relating to religion (sermons, religious texts, etc. are missing entirely, yet are among the most popular books for the wider population)
    \item Business-oriented documents (due to status as a PhD student)
    \item Medical texts
    \item Many academic subjects' materials.
\end{itemize}


% Missing: 
%
%  - school work
%  - Anything religious (sermon, religious texts)
%  - Business-oriented things
%  - medical stuff
%  - Many of the academic subjects
%  - 






% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Temporal Changes}
The BNC is now aging, and some changes are expected that likely generalise to enough of the BNC's population to make a significant difference to its representativeness.  Clearly, the personal corpus described here does not rigorously explore these, rather it is a heuristic for how such changes may affect the representativeness of a larger corpus in real-world terms.


Since the BNC pre-dates ubiquitous technology such as smartphones (and, largely, the web), it clearly omits what has been shown to be the largest single source of data in the personal corpus.  The severity of this impact is doubtless effected by the extreme technical experience/interests of the subject, who is both relatively young and technically capable, compared to the wider population, however, this trend is widely acknowledged and set to continue.

Arguable is the extent to which other genres have been co-opted by the web, suggesting that it is being used more as a transmission medium than a conventional genre.  The depth of this analysis is defined by one's purpose, though it is notable that the breakdown of text genres from web sources in the personal corpus extends Lee's `email' category into 8 sub-categories, all of which overlap significantly with those used elsewhere.  This pattern is repeated for the web (the personal corpus' largest source of data), which yields 68 genres with over 5 entries\footnote{I have excluded genres with low counts as these are unlikely to deserve their own category in Lee's classification, though a suitably scaled general purpose corpus is likely to include many.}.

Some genres have arisen that do not so easily map onto the original BNC design.  Email spam is one, presumably contained within the 'email' category.  Another is the use of social networks, which has no direct correspondence in the BNC genre listing, and could be thought of as a form of very informal news, or very informal social interaction in line with public debate (pub\_debate) or conversation(conv).







% ----------- outro for this subsection


It is unfortunate that the BNC, even with Lee's annotation, lacks sufficient demographic detail to identify where the subject falls within the BNC sampling frame.  This would allow approximate weights to be applied in order to rebalance the BNC as an augmentation of the personal corpus.

%---

Particularly interesting are instances where the hierarchical categorisation of the BNC indicates that both corpora have sampled from the same sources, yet the resulting within-category proportions differ.  This is true of many of the news sources, where there was a strong bias towards tech. news, and academic sources, which were focused on a single area.  We might reasonably expect this effect to be true for many sub-populations, who may prefer a given religion or set of recreational activities.
